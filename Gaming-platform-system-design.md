# Gaming platform system design

As software engineers, system architects, and developers, your expertise in system design and architecture principles is essential and a testament to your competence. Your role in making the right tech decisions at the basic and advanced optimization levels is crucial, and you are more than capable of creating a highly scalable backend infrastructure for the Online Gaming platform.

Rest assured, this document is not just a guide but a comprehensive one that covers all the principles you need to understand to create a highly scalable and efficient system design and architecture for gaming platforms.

## Software language

There are a lot of considerations when it comes to choosing the software language for a particular service. However, when it comes to high performance, scalability, and rich web support, I recommend using Golang for the following reasons:

-   Goroutines are lightweight threads that perform best with highly loaded services and utilize all CPU threads and cores.
-   Strict typing - improves the reliability of the services and prevents the probability of runtime issues.

## Databases

There is no generic approach to storing data, and database decisions are affected by the data structure and performance expectations.

SQL databases are better for cases with higher data consistency requirements. Then, it's better to consider NoSQL for use cases where scalability is prioritized over consistency.

To find the best database, we can use the CAP theorem, which states that a distributed system can only guarantee two properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. However, the most exciting part comes when consistency and scalability are required simultaneously.

## Achieving Consistency and Scalability at the same time

The first approach is to use a distributed SQL database like CockroachDB or Yugabyte.

While this approach might be convenient, achieving scalability at the service level is still better before scaling the database.

We can use the CQRS (Common Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern, where we store the data in the SQL database and write it into it. However, the data can also be duplicated and restructured into a NoSQL database so the client can read it in the structure it needs without using SQL join queries.

We can consider eventual consistency by introducing asynchronous operations to control the write load to the databases.

## Network partitioning

Network partitioning could be handled with eventual consistency using asynchronous communication. Many cloud architecture patterns can help design data flow to ensure that asynchronous processes happen successfully.

## Handling the traffic spikes

Although it's impossible to have an utterly elastic architecture that can scale from 10 requests per hour to 10000 users per second, it's still possible to have a certain level of elasticity that will allow the system to adapt to the traffic spike before manual action is required without downtime.

Stateless services could be easily auto-scalable based on CPU/RAM utilization, requests, or network throughput.

Databases usually require manual scalability, so preparing for the traffic spike requires some resources and a replica room.

## Real-time communication

For distributed systems, real-time communication should be achieved through message brokers. For instance, if a user in one region sends a message, it gets replicated across the globe in the message broker queue. Then, all the message receivers are subscribed to the replicate of the queue, so they get a real-time message in milliseconds.

## Security

Authentication and authorization happen by following the OAuth2.0 protocol, ensuring the best security level possible.

They are stored in encrypted databases in the private cloud.

The WAF rules on the API gateway will protect us from DDoS attacks and injection attacks.

TLS encryption will prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Disaster recovery

Disaster recovery requires thorough planning, and there are a couple of ways to implement the disaster recovery mechanism:

1.  Slow but cost-efficient. Following best practices for cloud infrastructure deployment enables this mechanism by default. When all the infrastructure is configured with IaaC and has backups, it can be quickly restored to a different availability zone or region when an outage occurs. However, this restoration takes time and can only be performed after some time.
2.  This approach is moderate and middle-priced. It is similar to the first one, but it creates data backups across multiple regions, so when an outage happens, we don't need to spend time restoring the backups from one region to another; we deploy the services to the new region. It speeds up the recovery time while keeping the costs moderate.
3.  This approach is fast but also expensive. It consists of keeping two identical deployment infrastructures in multiple regions so that when one region experiences an outage, the traffic is switched to another region with no downtime.

## Additional considerations

While architecture design is crucial for building highly scalable and efficient services, it's also important to mention the significance of other areas that influence their reliability.

### Site Reliability Engineering

Feel secure in the ongoing process of Site Reliability Engineering, which defines Service Level Agreements and error budgets that help us better understand how much risk we can handle within a given period to keep our service reliable.

### Development Operations

Keeping development operations structured and automated is essential for keeping up with the pace of releasing new features while paying attention to reliability.

### Product management

Proper product management operations are crucial to better understanding customer needs. Thus, technical decisions based on facts-proven requirements are adopted to realize and prepare for heavy traffic areas.
